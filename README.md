# Planned features
Features to be added in upcoming versions:
 - Many types of skills:
    1. Daily skills in which matters only if you complete specific task in a current day. 
    Example: Getting up at 6 AM.
    2. Accumulation skills in which the thing that matters is how much you complete of a specific task.
    Example: How many minutes have you played guitar? How many problems have you solved in last contest?
    Note: Accumulation will have daily/weekly/monthly completion bonuses as the consistency is crucial in achieving a goal.
 - New algorithm for calculating experience level needed to another level, also with scaling experience, so you level up equally often with skills for which you can spend different amount of time weekly.
 - Built-in pomodoro mechanism and timer which automatically calculates how much time you spend on a skill and gives you experience.
 - Reminders.
 - Optimised to-do-list:
    - You will be able to see only the element on the top, so you can better concentrate on your current task. If you split your goal into small and easily achievable pieces like: "clean the desk", "open the books", "start the pomodoro", then you avoid the procrastination associated with heaviness of the task like "write master thesis".
