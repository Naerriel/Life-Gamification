Chrome extension which allows you to measure your progress in your real life skills.

It contains pomodoro timer with logging of history and adding experience to skills predefinded by user.

## Installation:

You can install the extension at:

  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/life-gamification/bohnadmaammojkcpeglphdocobnlnepi?hl=en-US

## Contributing:

To install the extension as a developer, download the repository, write:
    
    npm install && npm run build

and then in Chrome Extensions tab open the Developer mode, press "Load unpacked" button and select the build folder.

## Notes:

Upon returning to the project after few months of inactivity I find many mistakes I made during development.
Current version of master is not the one present in the store (now I know I should distuingish branches develop and master)
and it also is broken (timer ends instantly after finish, without giving experience or starting a new session).

I think I may return in few months time to the project and rewrite it with better practices that I've learned
and with more helpful functionalities to the users.
